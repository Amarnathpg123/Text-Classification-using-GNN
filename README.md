# Text-Classification-using-GNN
This Repo contains the implemented models Graph Neural Network and Text Level Graph Neural Network. Although the data for GCN is quite too large to smooth running because of the size of the graph we get, Text Level GNN is working well with GPUs. Feel free to use the code.
